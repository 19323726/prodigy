# Prodigy Generative-AI Internship projects



🎨 Task-02 Completed: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models 🔥
🧠 Internship: Generative AI | Prodigy InfoTech

In this task, I explored the power of generative models in the field of computer vision. The objective was to generate images from textual prompts using pre-trained models like DALL·E-mini and Stable Diffusion. 🚀

✅ Key Takeaways:

🔹 Utilized DALL·E-mini and Stable Diffusion for creative image generation
🔹 Understood how text-to-image models interpret and visualize prompts
🔹 Experimented with various prompt styles to influence output quality
🔹 Learned the impact of latent diffusion models and CLIP embeddings
🔹 Gained practical exposure to prompt engineering for image synthesis

✨ Example Prompts I Used:

“A futuristic city under a starry sky”

“A cat reading a book in a library”

“An astronaut riding a horse on Mars”


This project enhanced my understanding of multi-modal AI systems and the exciting space where text meets vision. 🌐🖼

Grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for the opportunity to explore cutting-edge AI tools in a hands-on manner! 🙌
