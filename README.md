# Prodigy Generative-AI Internship projects

TAsk1
I’m excited to share that I recently completed my Generative AI Internship at Prodigy InfoTech, and it has been a truly transformative learning experience! 🌐💡

During the internship, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer Models, where I:

🧠 Learned to fine-tune GPT-2, a powerful generative language model by OpenAI
📄 Worked with custom datasets to generate text matching specific styles and tones
🔁 Understood the importance of prompt engineering, tokenization, and model evaluation
🛠 Built practical projects that mimic human-like writing with context and coherence

The hands-on exposure to training AI models to generate text based on given prompts not only strengthened my technical skills but also sparked a deeper interest in the future of AI-powered applications.

I'm thankful to Prodigy InfoTech for providing such a well-structured and mentor-supported platform to explore real-world applications of AI.

Highly recommend this internship to anyone looking to get started in Generative AI, GPT models, and NLP-based projects! 🌍

🎨 Task-02 Completed: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models 🔥
🧠 Internship: Generative AI | Prodigy InfoTech

In this task, I explored the power of generative models in the field of computer vision. The objective was to generate images from textual prompts using pre-trained models like DALL·E-mini and Stable Diffusion. 🚀

✅ Key Takeaways:

🔹 Utilized DALL·E-mini and Stable Diffusion for creative image generation
🔹 Understood how text-to-image models interpret and visualize prompts
🔹 Experimented with various prompt styles to influence output quality
🔹 Learned the impact of latent diffusion models and CLIP embeddings
🔹 Gained practical exposure to prompt engineering for image synthesis

✨ Example Prompts I Used:

“A futuristic city under a starry sky”

“A cat reading a book in a library”

“An astronaut riding a horse on Mars”


This project enhanced my understanding of multi-modal AI systems and the exciting space where text meets vision. 🌐🖼

Grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for the opportunity to explore cutting-edge AI tools in a hands-on manner! 🙌

In Task-03, I got hands-on experience with one of the most powerful transformer-based models—GPT-2 by OpenAI. The goal was to generate contextually meaningful and coherent text based on a given prompt. Here's what I achieved:

✅ Key Learnings & Achievements:

🔹 Explored the architecture and capabilities of GPT-2
🔹 Understood the tokenization process and attention mechanism
🔹 Fine-tuned GPT-2 on a custom dataset to generate domain-specific text
🔹 Learned how prompt design affects output quality and relevance
🔹 Evaluated and refined generated outputs to improve coherence and creativity

📝 Example Prompt:
"Train a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt."

🔁 Output:
A complete paragraph mimicking human-like writing — with logical flow and structure — all generated by AI.

This task gave me an in-depth understanding of Natural Language Generation (NLG) and the real-world applications of transformer models in content creation, virtual assistants, and more.

Grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for providing such a solid foundation in Generative AI through hands-on projects and guided learning. 🙌

🧠 Task-04 Completed: Image-to-Image Translation using Pix2Pix (cGAN)
🎯 Internship: Generative AI | Prodigy InfoTech

In this task, I explored one of the most powerful applications of deep learning — Image-to-Image Translation — using the pix2pix model, a type of Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). 🖼➡🖼

✅ Key Highlights:

🔹 Implemented the pix2pix architecture using TensorFlow
🔹 Trained the model on paired datasets (e.g., sketches ↔ real images)
🔹 Learned about generator-discriminator dynamics under conditional inputs
🔹 Applied L1 loss + adversarial loss for high-quality outputs
🔹 Visualized real-time translation results after each training epoch
🔹 Understood the balance between image realism and fidelity to input

📌 Real-World Applications:

Sketch → Photo conversion

Day → Night translation

Black & white → Colored images

Maps ↔ Satellite images


This task not only strengthened my understanding of GANs but also showed how AI can turn abstract concepts into visually creative outputs.

Grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for enabling this hands-on journey into the world of Generative AI and Computer Vision. The blend of theory and practice has been truly empowering!

🎨 Task-05 Completed: Neural Style Transfer (NST)
🧠 Internship: Generative AI | Prodigy InfoTech

In this task, I implemented a fascinating deep learning technique called Neural Style Transfer, which blends the content of one image with the style of another — creating stunning AI-generated art. 🖼✨

✅ What I Did:

🔹 Explored the use of pre-trained CNNs (VGG19) for feature extraction
🔹 Separated content and style representations from images
🔹 Applied Gram matrices to capture texture and style patterns
🔹 Used loss functions to balance content vs. style (content loss + style loss)
🔹 Implemented NST using TensorFlow/Keras for real-time visualization
🔹 Created final outputs where the content image looks like it was “painted” in the style of famous artworks

💡 Example:
🖼 Content image: A photograph of a city
🎨 Style image: A Van Gogh painting
👉 Result: The city photo rendered in the artistic style of Van Gogh!

This task beautifully demonstrated how deep learning + creativity can generate visually appealing art using just a few lines of code. It was both technically enriching and creatively satisfying.

Thank you Prodigy InfoTech for designing such exciting and artistic tasks in the field of Generative AI.
